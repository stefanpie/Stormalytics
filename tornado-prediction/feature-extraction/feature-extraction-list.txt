Feature Extaction List for Level II Doppler Weather Radar Scans

Radar Station / Whole Scan Data

- Latitude of radar station
- Longitude of radar station
- Elevation of radar station
- Timestamp data: month, day, hour, minute (maybe seconds but appears not necessary)

- Reflecticy 

- Lowest elevation angle for refelctivity scan
- Lowest elevation angle for relative velocity scan
- Lowest elevation angle for specrtum width scan

- Lowest elevation gate count for refelctivity scan
- Lowest elevation gate count for relative velocity scan
- Lowest elevation gate count for specrtum width scan

- Lowest elevation angle count for refelctivity scan
- Lowest elevation angle count for relative velocity scan
- Lowest elevation angle count for specrtum width scan
